# Preferences for Matt Vildibill

1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__ 
   * Any time 8am-12pm work. I prefer text and will do my best to answer quickly. 
1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
   * I think we will work great together and do whatever it takes to accomplish our assignments and goals. 
1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
   * I really like the format of this class and look forward to gaining addition industry related experiences.
1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   * I am mostly worried about my classload this semester and time allocation. But I think with proper planning everything will work out fine. 
1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   * We will all strive to accomplish not only our own goals, but those of our teammates as well. 
1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   * No, and if that is the case I beleive work effort and participation will be refelcted in our grades. 
1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   * Impossible to know yet but I am guessing around 15-20hrs. 
1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   * Communication through slack and being transparent about what we prefer to work on, and our strengths and weaknesses. 
1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   * We will work as a team to do our best and complete whatever couldn't be completed. 
1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   * Nothing is ever perfect, so if someone thinks something can be done better then we will work to make it better. 
1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
   * We are all busy and no week will ever be the same so we have to work together and adjust/support eachother. 
1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   * I am impartial. I work well in person but I am also more efficient at home with multiple monitors. Either works. 
1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   * Up to my team members preferences. And again, every week is different so it's impossible to know. 
1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   * On important decisions, yes. On trivial decisions, no. But communicating through slack and being as transparent as possible is necessary. 
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   * We can find a compromise. And if there is no compromise then we can always take it to a vote. 
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   * Be honest and tell them how I feel and how I think our team could be doing better. 
1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   * Confront my teammates and tell them I need more help and for others to take on more responsibility.
