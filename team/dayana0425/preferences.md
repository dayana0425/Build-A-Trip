# Preferences for *Daiana Bilbao*

1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__ 
   * It's easier by Slack. I have Slack on my phone and desktop so it should be no problem. Anytime between 8am-9pm. I'm usually online doing online classes/working from home.
1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
   * I expect we will be amazing and get an A.
1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
   * My personal goal is to be as helpful as possible to my teammates and not just focusing on my part of the work. If we can all help eachother succeed then our overall project will be successful and we will get an A.  
1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   *  I think that it is a lot more difficult to ask for help given the enviornment. It takes more effort and time. You have to type out what you're having trouble with and someone may not always be available to help you
1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   * If you don't aim high then you will end up with a lower grade than a B. It makes sense to aim for an A, and if we get a B then we get a B but we have to try to get an A.
1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   * No. We will get an A together. I would not want someone to feel responsible to do extra work. That's not fair to them. 
1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   * I'm guessing 10 hours but I'm not sure about the workload.
1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   * We should look at everyone's strengths and then decide or if someone is interested in learning a new technology then they can volunteer. 
1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   * If they have not communicated anything to our team about the issue then it will really hurt our team and we will need to contact Dave to see what can be done. If they feel like they can't complete something - they should inform the team beforehand and then we can work out a plan.
1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   * It should be communicated nicely for future improvement but I wouldn't stress about changing past work when the work is done and does it's job. 
1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
   * We should discuss our work habits so that it's not a surprise to any of us but we should respect eachother's work habits because that's how we each work best and as long as it gets done before the deadline then it's fine. 
1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   * I think we should meet outside class if needed like if our entire project breaks and we all need to fix it.
1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   * Hopefully things go smoothly.
1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   * Depends on the decision. If it will impact every team member then it should be announced and agreed upon. 
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   * We should discuss it if the person feels really strongly. Then vote again or compromise. 
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   * They should be considerate of others ideas. I would make an effort to voice my own ideas and asking other teammates what they think to open up the conversation.
1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   * I will communicate to my teammates how I feel and that I would like them to contribute more.
