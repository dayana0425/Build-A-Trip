# Preferences for _Allie Julian_

1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__ 
   * Text or Slack/Teams/etc. message is easiest, email is okay if you have to. Pretty much any time 8AM-8PM is good assuming I'm not working/doing class stuff right then.
1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
   * I want us to finish all the projects to the best of our ability without getting frustrated with eachother
1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
   * Depending on others to get their part of a project done stresses me out, so I'd like to learn to be better about trusting my teammates
1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   * Online class chaos can make communication tricky, and this will be my first time using GitHub extensively
1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   * Assuming there's no outside reason not to, we go for an A. There's no reason to set expectations low.
1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   * If it's a difference of maybe 5-10% more work, sure. Anything more than that and it's not fair.
1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   * Individually probably 5-10 hours per week, probably around 30 hours a week for the whole group 
1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   * Group consensus, with the less popular stuff rotated around if we need to
1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   * Talk to the person about what happened and let the instructor/TAs know if it becomes a regular issue
1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   * As long as it works and the rest of the team understands it, there's no reason to nitpick the quality of someone's contributions. It's mean-spirited.
1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
   * Be as accommodating as possible as long as it doesn't affect the work of other teammates
1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   * Not unless absolutely necessary, and if we do end up having one I would prefer that it's online due to COVID
1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   * Hopefully we never have to meet formally outside of class, but realistically maybe once or twice per project
1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   * You need the approval of every team member whose work is affected by the decision
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   * Go with what the group wants unless it mostly only affects the person who disagrees
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   * Ask them politely to make space for the other team members' ideas
1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   * Ask my team for help first, then talk to the instructor/TAs if it doesn't get better/gets worse
