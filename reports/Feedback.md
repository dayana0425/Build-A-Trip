# User Experience - Feedback

1. Distance is a bit not precise enough. When click two close places, it always shows 0.

2. After first trip reset, there will be a default place which is the departure of last trip.
The user cannot change the departure point then.

3. Sometimes search results are not accurate. When searching London, only the fourth of the
top 5 airports is in London.

4. If keep clicking Zoom out, the map will eventually show every continent twice.

5. If there is no default place, need a User Location button.
