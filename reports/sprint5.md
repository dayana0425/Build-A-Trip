## Planned Epics
### Shorter
For the Shorter epic this sprint, we plan to add an optimize button to the client side to show the difference when we optimize and improve our optimiziation, so that our result responds quickly.
### User Experience
To improve the user experience of our site, we plan to fix our home marker because it disappears, add a button to toggle between having lines showing or not showing, and change the placement of our buttons to our map to reduce clutter and scrolling on our site.
### File Formats
For this epic, we plan to add support for saving our trips as KML, SVG, and CSV formats to go along with JSON, and include a pop up to select what format the user wants.
### Place Details
For Place Details, we plan to convert latitude and longitude to a textual description, and display this information both on the map and in the itinerary.
### Modify Trip
For this epic, we plan to allow the user to select a new starting location, reverse the order of a trip, reorder the trip however they want, remove certain destinations, and add destination notes.
### Where Is?
For Where Is, we plan to allow the user to enter latitude and longitude coordinates in any format that they want and convert them to a format that our site can utilize.
## Metrics

| Statistic | # Planned | # Completed |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Epics | 6 | *count* |
| Tasks |  25   | *count* | 
| Story Points |  46  | *sum* | 

### Metrics Outlook
Sprint 4 was our best sprint of the semester so far as a team and we believe that our communication and teamwork have gotten better as the semester goes on. Last sprint we completed four out of the five epics, but we were really close to completing all of them. While we have six epics planned for this sprint, we also have an extra week and we believe we can complete all of them if we continue to work well together and put in the time required.
