## Planned Epics

**Epic 1: v1 protocol**

Our first Epic will be v1 protocol where we will be satisfying our client's request to view the server capabilities of each server the client is connected to. 
We will create a footer that the client can click on to view each server's information. We will also be giving the footer associated icons that will communicate the current connection status (green or red for connected or not connected) and that more information is available (a plus sign to indicate that information is available and no plus sign to indicate that there's nothing new).

**Epic 2: Team Identification**

Our team is the team 16, and our name is Team Hexadecimal. This epic will identify our team's identity by specifying our team name on the website. 

**Epic 3: About**

In this epic we will add our team's mission statement. Then we will add the information (name, image, short biography) of each team member. After completing this epic each individual member of our team will be individually introduced. 

**Epic 4: Where Am I?**

In this epic we will create a feature that allows the user to know their current location and also add a feature that will allow the user to return to their current location if they deviate from that location. 

**Epic 5: Where Is?**

In this epic we will create a feature that allows the user to enter latitude and longitude and display the given location on the map.
