## Planned Epics

**Epic 1: v1 protocol**

Our first Epic will be v1 protocol where we will be satisfying our client's request to view the server capabilities of each server the client is connected to. 
We will create a footer that the client can click on to view each server's information. We will also be giving the footer associated icons that will communicate the current connection status (green or red for connected or not connected) and that more information is available (a plus sign to indicate that information is available and no plus sign to indicate that there's nothing new).

**Epic 2: Team Identification**

Our team is the team 16, and our name is Team Hexadecimal. This epic will identify our team's identity by specifying our team name on the website. 

**Epic 3: About**

In this epic we will add our team's mission statement. Then we will add the information (name, image, short biography) of each team member. After completing this epic each individual member of our team will be individually introduced. 

**Epic 4: Where Am I?**

In this epic we will create a feature that allows the user to know their current location and also add a feature that will allow the user to return to their current location if they deviate from that location. 

**Epic 5: Where Is?**

In this epic we will create a feature that allows the user to enter latitude and longitude and display the given location on the map.

## Review

#### Epics done  
We finished 3/5 Epics.
#### Epics not done 
We didn't finish 2/5 Epics. 
#### What went well
The tasks associated with the About epic went smoothly once there was a skeleton created all team members we able to add their bio/image/name. 
#### Problems encountered and resolutions
Our communication struggled due to everyone having different schedules but we were able to get all the tasks that we wanted to get done. We are still working on how we can all work together more often.  
## Retrospective

#### What went well
When dealing with problems we were each having, we communicated our problems to eachother and tried to help eachother to resolve those issues.
#### Potential improvements
Potential improvements are to better synchronize our schedules so that more team members are readily available to help while working on tasks. We also need to better improve how we assign tasks so that the work load is balanced among team members. 
#### What we will change next time
We will synchronize schedules and better balance the work load amongst each other. We will have weekly meetings (in combination with scrum meetings) to discuss our schedules and abilities to do certain tasks.
