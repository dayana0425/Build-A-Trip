# Team Preferences

Availability

_Communication_

We will use Slack for casual group conversations and Teams for voice/video chat. We have a Slack and Teams group chat setup already. We will also be using Teams to notify the entire group of team meetings so each team member should have their Team notifications on at the very least. 

Team Goal

**Team Responsibilities**

Our team will be available for meetings on Mondays, and we will communicate our outside work schedules with eachother a reasonable amount of time in advance. If something comes up during the week that will limit our availability, we will let the other team members know at least a day before our availability is limited. We will each complete our part of an assignment early enough to not interfere with other team members' ability to finish their parts.
