# Team Preferences

__Availability__

We will plan on meeting on Monday's every week to discuss our individual availability for the coming week. As many of us have jobs we will have to adapt our availability each week. As far as classes and general availability go, we all have time to meet Monday/Wednesday/Friday in the late afternoon and evenings. We also all have our Tuesday and Thursday evenings available after 4pm. 

__Communication__

We will use Slack for casual group conversations and Teams for voice/video chat. We have a Slack and Teams group chat setup already. We will also be using Teams to notify the entire group of team meetings so each team member should have their Team notifications on at the very least. 

**Team Goal**

We are all trying to get an A in this class since if we set up a higher goal we could work harder to achieve it. Besides, this is not only an individual's work but also a team’s work, so we’ll all try to make as much effort as we can.

**Team Responsibilities**

Our team will be available for meetings on Mondays, and we will communicate our outside work schedules with eachother a reasonable amount of time in advance. If something comes up during the week that will limit our availability, we will let the other team members know at least a day before our availability is limited. We will each complete our part of an assignment early enough to not interfere with other team members' ability to finish their parts.

**Decision Making/Conflict Resolution**

The most important thing for making decisions or resolving conflicts in our group is communication. When we assign tasks in the group, we will let everyone use their strengths through communication. When we have a conflict, we will also solve the problem through communication under the premise of mutual respect.
