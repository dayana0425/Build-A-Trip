# Team Preferences

_Availability_

We will plan on meeting on Monday's every week to discuss our individual availability for the coming week. As many of us have jobs we will have to adapt our availability each week. As far as classes and general availability go, we all have time to meet Monday/Wednesday/Friday in the late afternoon and evenings. We also all have our Tuesday and Thursday evenings available after 4pm. 

__Communication__

We will use Slack for casual group conversations and Teams for voice/video chat. We have a Slack and Teams group chat setup already. We will also be using Teams to notify the entire group of team meetings so each team member should have their Team notifications on at the very least.
